# Ship Engineer

_Better title pending..._

You control an engineer, who must keep spaceship systems online for a battle you can't see.

System uptime determines success, and all systems eventually tie back to power usage. Reactor health is the most
important aspect.

* Control a person avatar around a grid based engineering facility.

events. Maybe there will be multiple enemies?

## Gameplay

Subsystems are consuming power from the reactor. The reactor needs to be topped up regularly. Subsystems combined draw
more power than the reactor can maintain and need to be turned on manually. Messages from the crew tell the engineer
what needs to be turned on.

The ship is currently engaged in an unseen battle, correct systems allow the ship to last longer. Incorrect systems
can damage the ship, eg missing shields result in laser damage.
